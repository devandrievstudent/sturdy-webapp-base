# âš¡ Sturdy web app base

## Initial setup
This repository comes without the `node_modules` folder, so before using this library and/or building please run:  ```npm install``` to install the required modules.
## Usage
The web app base uses `@material/web` library, so to use the Material Design components follow the guide at the [Material Web's repository.](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/tree/main/docs/components)

## Build
Once you are done writing your code, you can build the project to html by using `rollup -c`. If you do not allow external PowerShell scripts, you can use `npx rollup -c` instead.
